Translation Guide
===================

The Topic Explorer aims to be accessible in different languages. This guide
serves as an introduction to *internationalization* (or `i18n` for short, as the
word "internationalization" has 18 letters following the "i"). After using this
guide, you should be able to add a translation in a new language.

Concepts
----------

The process of making a translation can be seen as generating three different files:

1.  **.pot** -- A `.pot` file defines a template that contains all of the English-language strings that need to be translated into the new language. The InPhO-TE template is in `topic-explorer/locale/topicexplorer.pot` and is  generated by `make_translation.sh`.
2.  **.po** -- A `.po` file defines a specific translation of the strings. This file is created from the `.pot` file and is edited by the translator using **[poedit](https://poedit.net/)**.
3.  **.mo** -- A `.mo` file defines the machine-representation of the translation. This file is automatically generated by poedit.

Topic Explorer uses the [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) i18n conventions, as implemented by the [Python `gettext` library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/gettext.html). 

Getting Started
-----------------

To make a new translation:

1.  [Perform a "developer install" of InPhO-TE](https://github.com/inpho/topic-explorer#developer-install).
2.  Install [poedit](https://poedit.net/).
3.  Open poedit and click "Create new translation".
4.  Navigate to your developer install and select the `locale/topicexplorer.pot` file.
5.  Type in the language you wish to use.
6.  Use the poedit interface to add translations for each string.
7.  Look up the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for your language. For example, English is `en`, Chinese is `zh`, German is `de`, and Russian is `ru`.
8.  Save your file to the InPhO-TE locale directory: `topic-explorer/locale/ISO_CODE_HERE/topicexplorer.po`. poedit will automatically create the `topicexplorer.mo` file.
9.  Test your translation by using the `topicexplorer` command.

Contact the developers for further help on merging your translation to the codebase.
