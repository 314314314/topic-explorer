This is the **InPhO Topic Explorer**.  It allows you to explore documents in a corpus using pre-trained topic models.  **Topic models** represent documents as **mixtures** of topics. The topic model is trained by an algorithm that finds latent (hidden) relationships among the documents.  Typically we train models with different numbers of topics. If you would like more information about topic modeling, you can read [Blei 2012](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf) or watch the video at [http://inphodata.cogs.indiana.edu](http://inphodata.cogs.indiana.edu).

From this page, you will find some information about the corpus used to train the models, if it has been provided by however set up the Topic Explorer.  

Starting on this page you can explore the topic models in various ways using the large buttons in the middle of the page.  

## Left Menu

Clicking on a number will take you to the **Hypershelf** for the model that has the corresponding number of topics. Use the help function on that page to find out what to do next.

Clicking on the Topics (vertical bars) icon will take you to a map that lays out and groups the topics from all the models according to their similarity. There is also additional help once you reach that page.

## Documents

The most effective way to start exploring via the documents in the corpus.  

Once you click here a panel will appear in which you can either **clicking the crossed arrows button for a random document** or select a focal document for your exploration by **typing a few letters to match the title**.

You will be shown a “fingerprint” for the selected document, and you can navigate from this to the Hypershelf focused on that document.

## Topic

Clicking here will bring up a panel where you can enter a few words to identify related topics. From there you can go to the topics map.
